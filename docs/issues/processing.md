Issues and Opportunities
Looking at both the code and test results, I've identified several optimization opportunities:

Specifications Processing: The specifications file takes disproportionately long to process. I can see from the sample content that it's highly structured with multiple sections that might benefit from a different processing approach.
Token Management: While we avoided the token limit error in this run, the specifications file used nearly all available tokens. A more efficient prompt or chunking strategy could help.
Drawing Type-Specific Optimization: Different drawing types could benefit from specialized processing strategies based on their unique characteristics.

Recommendation: Implement Multi-Stage Processing for Specifications
I recommend implementing a specialized processor for specification files that:

First extracts the section headers and structure
Then processes each section individually
Finally combines them into a unified structured output

This approach would:

Reduce token usage per API call
Allow parallel processing of sections
Improve processing time for large specification documents
Maintain the quality of extraction
